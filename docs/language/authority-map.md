# Aipo — Document Authority Map

**Status:** normative
**Authority:** Level 2 (process/document governance; subordinate to the canonical decisions recorded in `docs/canon/`)
**Scope:** which Aipo document defines what, who may override whom, and which documents are canonical, derived, historical or experimental
**Domain/Owner:** Aipo language implementation — documentation governance
**Dependencies:** `docs/PRUMO.md` (router), `prumo.json`
**Update Triggers:** any change to documentation structure, authority, or supersession
**Related ADPs:** none yet
**Supersedes:** none
**Superseded By:** none

---

## Authority hierarchy (applies on conflict)

When two documents disagree, resolve by the first rule that applies:

1. **Canonical decisions explicitly approved** and materialized in this repository
   (wave gates, accepted ADPs, MVP scope, gate definitions).
2. **Language Reference + Canonical Syntax + Semantics**
   (`docs/canon/Aipo V1 — Language Reference …md`, `docs/canon/Aipo V1 — Sintaxe Canônica Consolidada …md`,
   semantic sections of `docs/canon/Aipo Language — Especificação Viva …md`).
3. **Accepted ADPs** (`docs/adp/`).
4. **Architecture contracts and crate contracts**
   (`docs/architecture/`, `docs/crates/`).
5. **Approved conformance fixtures and snapshots** (`docs/conformance/`, fixtures in crates).
6. **Implementation docs** (`docs/implementation/`, `docs/journal/`).
7. **Generated docs/adapters/indexes** (anything marked `derived`).
8. **Historical/experimental docs** (`docs/canon/` materials marked historical; rejected experiments).

Recency alone never resolves a contradiction. A contradiction is registered via
`prumo docs contradictions`, recorded as an ADP/open question, and only the
ambiguous segment is blocked (no-invention policy).

## Document classification

| Document | Location | Class | Defines |
|---|---|---|---|
| Language Reference V1 | `docs/canon/Aipo V1 — Language Reference …` | **canonical (normative)** | user-facing language semantics |
| Canonical Syntax V1 | `docs/canon/Aipo V1 — Sintaxe Canônica Consolidada …` | **canonical (normative)** | V1 syntax surface |
| Living Spec | `docs/canon/Aipo Language — Especificação Viva …` | canonical, historical-laden | decisions with rationale; normative where not superseded |
| Stdlib V1 Canônica | `docs/canon/Aipo — Stdlib V1 Canônica …` | canonical (normative) | stdlib contracts (MVP subset selected in `docs/stdlib/`) |
| Waves/Gauntlet | `docs/canon/Aipo — Waves, Vertical Slices …` | canonical (normative) | slice/wave/gate process |
| Rust Engineering Standard | `docs/canon/Aipo — Rust Engineering Standard …` | canonical (normative) | Rust code quality policy |
| Workspace Architecture | `docs/canon/Aipo — Arquitetura Modular …` | canonical (normative) | crate topology + dependency rules |
| Doc System for Agents | `docs/canon/Aipo — Sistema de Documentação …` | canonical (normative) | documentation & agent process |
| Fechamento Arquitetural | `docs/canon/Aipo — Fechamento Arquitetural 10 10 …` | canonical (normative) | closed design areas (JS backend, sandbox, packages, tooling, perf) |
| Governance/Evolution | `docs/canon/Governança de Design e Evolução …` | canonical (normative) | feature admission, ADP process |
| Rust/Poppy Pivot & Roadmap | `docs/canon/Aipo — Rust Poppy Pivot …` | canonical (normative) | host profiles, roadmap |
| Standard Library Architecture | `docs/canon/Aipo — Standard Library Architecture …` | canonical | stdlib layering |
| Implementation book + chapters + interludes | `docs/canon/Construindo a Aipo …`, `Capítulo …`, `Interlúdio …`, `Parte …`, `01–06 …` | **historical / pedagogical** | how we learn/build; Odin-era material is historical. Decision content already superseded by Language Reference is not normative. |
| Backlog pós-V1 | `docs/canon/Aipo — Backlog de Sintaxe …` | non-normative | ideas explicitly not in V1 |
| Biblioteca de Referências | `docs/canon/Aipo — Biblioteca de Referências …` | non-normative | external references |
| authority-map (this file) | `docs/language/authority-map.md` | meta | documentation authority |
| crate contracts | `docs/crates/*.md` | normative (architecture level) | per-crate contracts |
| architecture docs | `docs/architecture/*.md` | normative (architecture level) | workspace, IR, bytecode, VM boundaries |
| waves plan | `docs/waves/wave-1-mvp.md` | normative (process level) | Wave 1 slices + MVP gate |
| feature packs | `docs/features/*/*.md` | normative per feature | feature contracts |
| diagnostics catalog | `docs/diagnostics/catalog.md` | normative | stable diagnostic codes |
| testing strategy | `docs/development/testing-strategy.md` | normative | validation levels + gates |
| ADPs | `docs/adp/ADP-*.md` | normative when accepted; draft otherwise | design decisions |
| journal | `docs/journal/*.md` | record (non-normative) | implementation decisions log |
| evidence | `docs/evidence/*.md` | record | proof attachments for gates |
| docs/PRUMO.md | `docs/PRUMO.md` | derived router | navigation; never overrides canon |

## Rule sets that bind everything

- **No-invention policy:** a material semantic question without a canon answer becomes
  an open question → proposal/ADP → fixture. Only non-ambiguous parts get implemented.
- **One canonical form:** no alias surfaces are added; superseded forms are recorded as superseded.
- **Evidence policy:** "implemented/compatible/safe/fast/10" claims require attached evidence.
- **Drift policy:** changes to grammar/semantics/IR/bytecode/stdlib/diagnostics/CLI must run
  `prumo docs impact` / `docs delta` / `docs contradictions`; stale docs are not silently ignored.

## Supersession ledger (extract)

| Superseded form | Canonical form | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `for` iteration | `each` | Canonical Syntax 2026-09-07 |
| `where`/`@` field rules | `fixed` + `invariant()` | Canonical Syntax 2026-09-07 |
| `fn Type.name(...)` associated syntax | `impl Type` + `self`/`self!` | Canonical Syntax 2026-09-07 |
| `case` | `when` (match) | Language Reference |
| `try` / `or` / `try … else … end` | `or_else` + `attempt/failed` | Language Reference (Lote 5 / decisão posterior) |
| `expression else fallback` | `expression or_else fallback` | Language Reference (decisão posterior) |
| Int as full signed 64-bit | Int = ±(2^53 − 1) | Canonical Syntax 2026-09-10 (numérico) |
| `T?` beyond signatures/`is` | contracts only in signatures | Language Reference |
