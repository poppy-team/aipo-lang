# Aipo — MVP Stdlib Subset (Wave 1, Slices S9 + backend completion)

**Status:** normative (implementation level)
**Authority:** subordinate to `docs/canon/` (`Aipo — Stdlib V1 Canônica …`, `Aipo V1 — Language Reference`,
`Aipo Language — Especificação Viva`) and to `docs/waves/wave-1-mvp.md` (S9 deliverable)
**Scope:** the closed V1 stdlib surface implemented by `aipo-stdlib`, `aipo-runtime` and the
collection methods bound by `aipo-vm`
**Crates:** `crates/aipo-runtime`, `crates/aipo-stdlib`, `crates/aipo-vm`, `crates/aipo-cli`
**Update Triggers:** function added/removed/renamed, arity change, argument rule change,
new runtime value kind, any change to the Failure/fault split below
**Related:** `docs/crates/crate-contracts.md`,
`docs/adp/ADP-001-byte-and-core-types-as-values.md`,
`docs/adp/ADP-002-construction-hooks-and-runtime-contracts.md`,
`docs/evidence/P00-G15-static-contracts-and-interface-conformance.md`

This document records **what is implemented today**, not what canon plans for later
waves. Anything canon decides that is not listed here is either deferred (see
[Deferred surface](#deferred-surface)) or recorded as a decision in `docs/adp/` — ADP-001
(types as values, tolerant slicing, NFC, `clamp` bounds) and ADP-002 (construction hooks,
invariants and runtime contracts) are both resolved, so every choice below has a canon source.

## Runtime layer (`aipo-runtime`)

- **`ModuleGraph`** — registered module records keyed by canonical path.
- **`topological_init_order()`** — deterministic initialization order: every dependency is
  initialized before its dependents; ties are broken lexicographically by canonical path.
  Missing dependencies yield `ModuleNotFound`; circular imports yield `CyclicDependency`
  with the offending chain.
- **`ModuleRecord` / `ModuleState`** — lifecycle `Uninitialized → Initializing → Initialized`
  (`Failed(reason)` on error). A module publishes nothing until it reaches `Initialized`
  (failed init publishes nothing).
- **`NativeRegistry`** — catalog of native function metadata (name, arity, owning module,
  documentation) used by tooling to describe the Prelude and built-in modules.
- Diagnostics: `ModuleNotFound → AIPO_SEM_UNKNOWN_MODULE`,
  `CyclicDependency → AIPO_SEM_IMPORT_CYCLE`,
  `ExportNotFound → AIPO_SEM_EXPORT_UNKNOWN`.

Module *execution* (`import`/`export`/init-once wiring into the VM) was not part of S9; it is
implemented in `crates/aipo-cli/src/modules.rs` by the backend-completion goal (`P00-G10`),
which consumes the registry and ordering above: one `.aipo` file is one module, dependencies are
loaded before dependents, a module's top-level statements run exactly once, and privacy is
enforced by name resolution (a non-exported declaration is renamed to `<module>::<name>`, so an
importer that names it gets `AIPO_SEM_EXPORT_UNKNOWN`).

## Prelude V1

Available without import. Canon forbids turning the Prelude into a convenience dump, so
`print`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `random`, `sleep`, `open`, `json`, `assert`, `min` and
`max` are deliberately **not** global.

### Values

| Name | Kind |
|---|---|
| `none` | `none` |
| `true` | `Bool` |
| `false` | `Bool` |

Every core type is also a **first-class type value** (`Value::Type`), so the names `none`,
`Bool`, `Int`, `Float`, `Byte`, `String`, `List`, `Dict`, `Bytes` and `Range` are all bound in
the Prelude with an identity, a canonical `name` and structural equality. `Int`, `Float`, `Byte`
and `String` additionally accept a call, which is the conversion documented below; `List`,
`Dict` and `Bytes` are type values only — they have no call form in V1 (`list(x)` is not defined).

### Functions

| Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `len(value)` | Code point count for `String`, element count for `List`/`Dict`. Propagates `Failure`; any other type is a fault. |
| `copy(value)` | Shallow copy of `List`, `Dict` or `Struct` (new identity); scalars are returned unchanged. |
| `same(a, b)` | Reference identity for `List`/`Dict`/`Struct`, content equality for primitives. |
| `some(value)` | `false` only for `none`; every other value (including `false` and `0`) is `some`. |
| `fail(message)` | Builds a recoverable `Failure` value. |

### Conversions

| Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Int(value)` | `Float` truncates toward zero; `String` is parsed as a whole. Out-of-range or invalid text yields a recoverable `Failure`. `Bool`/collections are a fault. |
| `Float(value)` | Widens `Int`; parses `String`. Invalid text or a non-finite result yields a recoverable `Failure`. |
| `Byte(value)` | Verified `0..=255` from `Int`, integral `Float` or `String`. Never wraps around, never saturates: out-of-range is a recoverable `Failure`. |
| `String(value)` | Canonical textual conversion for `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `none`, using the VM's rendering, so `String(v)` and `io.print(v)` agree. Collections, structs and functions are a fault (no magic stringification). |

Text parsing is strict: surrounding whitespace is not silently skipped (`string.trim`
first if needed).

## `List` / `Dict` methods

Bound by `aipo-stdlib` and dispatched by the VM through the receiver, so `xs.len()` and
`len(xs)` agree.

| Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `list.add(value)` | Appends; returns the list. |
| `list.insert(index, value)` | Inserts at a code-point-style index; out-of-range is a fault. |
| `list.remove(value)` | Removes the first equal element; a missing element is a no-op. |
| `list.remove_at(index)` / `list.remove_last()` | Remove by position; out-of-range is a fault. |
| `list.clear()` | Empties in place. |
| `list.contains(value)` / `list.find(value)` | Membership; `find` returns the index or `none`. |
| `list.first()` / `list.last()` | First/last element, or `none` when empty. |
| `list.is_empty()` / `list.len()` / `list.count(value)` | Size and counting. |
| `list.reverse()` | Reverses in place using the canonical ordering. |
| `list.sort()` / `list.sort_by(key_fn)` | In-place sort; `sort_by` orders by the key the callable returns. |
| `list.transform(fn)` / `list.filter(fn)` / `list.sort_by(fn)` | Higher-order: the callable is invoked **through the VM** (not from Rust), so closures, `fail` and faults behave exactly as at any other call site. |
| `dict.has(key)` / `dict.get(key)` | Presence and lookup; a missing key in `get` is `none`. |
| `dict.keys()` / `dict.values()` | Ordered projections. |
| `dict.remove(key)` / `dict.clear()` / `dict.is_empty()` / `dict.len()` | Removal and size. |

Mutating a `List`/`Dict` while it is being iterated (`each`, `filter`, `transform`) raises the
inconditional runtime fault `AIPO_RT_MUTATION_DURING_ITERATION`.

### `Bytes`

`Bytes` is a managed, mutable binary block (`Value::Bytes`). Canon's construction form is
`Bytes(count: Int)`, which allocates `count` zero-filled bytes; indexing works by byte and
yields `Byte`, `len` reports the count and slicing returns a new block. A negative or oversized
count is a recoverable `Failure` (`BYTES_MAX_ALLOCATION` is a provisional 64 MiB cap so a
source-level size cannot exhaust memory). Packing APIs (`read_i32`, `write_f32`, …) and
`String.encode()`/`Bytes.decode()` are outside this subset.

## `math`

| Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `abs(x)` | `Int` → `Int`, `Float` → `Float`; overflow of `Int::MIN` is a fault. |
| `min(a, b)` / `max(a, b)` | Mixed operands follow `Int -> Float` promotion. |
| `floor(x)` / `ceil(x)` / `round(x)` / `truncate(x)` | Return `Int` when representable; the result outside the `Int` range is a fault. `round` is half **away from zero** (`round(2.5) == 3`, `round(-2.5) == -3`). |
| `sqrt(x)` | Always `Float`; a negative input yields a recoverable `Failure`. |
| `pow(base, exponent)` | `Int ** Int(>= 0)` stays `Int` while it fits; otherwise `Float`. Non-finite results are a fault. |
| `clamp(value, min, max)` | Inclusive interval; mixed operands promote to `Float`. Inverted bounds (`min > max`) produce a recoverable `Failure`: a bound is a *value* outside a valid range, and canon reserves `Failure` for exactly that (like `Byte(value)` out of range), while an *index* outside a range is a fault. `or_else` recovers (ADP-001 Q3, closed by `P00-G15`). |

Constants: `math.pi`, `math.e`.

## `string`

All text operations work on Unicode **code points**, never raw bytes. `len` counts code
points; `byte_len` exposes the UTF-8 byte length.

| Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `len(text)` | Code point count. |
| `byte_len(text)` | UTF-8 byte length. |
| `contains(text, sub)` / `starts_with(text, prefix)` / `ends_with(text, suffix)` | The empty needle matches (`true`). |
| `find(text, sub)` | Code point index of the first match as `Int`, or `none` when absent. `find(text, "") == 0`. |
| `lower(text)` / `upper(text)` | Locale-neutral, deterministic, full Unicode case mapping. Normalized to NFC, like every operation that can join a base character with a combining mark. |
| `capitalize(text)` | Titlecases the first cased character, lowercases the remaining cased characters; leading punctuation, digits and symbols are preserved; text without cased characters is unchanged. |
| `reverse(text)` | Reverses **extended grapheme clusters** (composed units stay intact) and re-normalizes the result to NFC. |
| `trim(text)` | Strips leading/trailing whitespace. |
| `split(text, separator)` | List of substrings; **separator must be non-empty**; empty fields are preserved, including at the edges (`"a,,b" → ["a", "", "b"]`, `"" → [""]`). |
| `join(separator, list)` | `join(separator, []) == ""`; a one-element list returns that element; **every element must already be `String`** — there is no implicit textual coercion (use `String(value)`). |
| `replace(text, from, to)` | Replaces all non-overlapping matches; **`from` must be non-empty**. |
| `slice(text, start, end)` | Half-open `[start, end)` over code points; negative indices count from the end; out-of-range bounds are clamped to the string (canon: "slices fora da faixa são tolerantes/clamped" — the slice category rule, so it holds for `List`, `String` and `Bytes` alike; ADP-001 Q4, closed by `P00-G15`). |
| `format(template, values)` | Named `{name}` placeholders with `values` as a `Dict`; `{{`/`}}` are literal braces; extra keys are ignored; missing key, malformed template or positional placeholder (`{0}`, `{}`) yields a recoverable `Failure`. |

## `io`

| Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `print(value)` | Writes the textual rendering without a trailing newline; returns `none`. |
| `println(value)` | Same, with a trailing newline. |

`io::set_output_sink` lets tests and embedders capture output deterministically.

## `time`

Canon classifies non-deterministic sources as **host capabilities**, so the clock is not a
language primitive: it is a service the host installs, and a program cannot tell a real clock
from a replay's fixed one.

| Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `now()` | Wall clock as `Duration` seconds since the Unix epoch. Requires the `clock.wall` capability. |
| `monotonic()` | Monotonic clock as `Duration` seconds from an arbitrary fixed origin, never decreasing. Requires the `clock.monotonic` capability. |

Neither function has a fallback: with no clock installed the reading is a runtime fault with the
stable code `AIPO_RT_CAPABILITY_DENIED` naming the capability, exactly like any other denied
operation. `time::install_clock` grants the capability (the CLI profile installs `SystemClock`,
so `aipo run` reads the operating system's clocks) and `time::revoke_clock` denies it; a
deterministic profile installs its own `ClockSource`, which is what makes a replay replay. The
`aipo-js` shim mirrors this: the emitted entry installs the system clock, and a host that needs
determinism installs its own source on `globalThis.__aipoClock` before the bundle loads, or sets
it to `null` to deny.

`Date`/`TimeOfDay`/`DateTime` are **not** part of this surface: their calendar, offset and IANA
timezone contracts are a separate decision, and inventing a representation here would preempt it.

## `String` and Unicode normalization

NFC is an **invariant** of every `String` value, not an operation performed at `==`. It is
established where a `String` is constructed and where an operation can introduce a
non-normalized result (ADP-001 Q5, closed by `P00-G15`):

| Boundary | Where |
|---|---|
| Literal decoding (all prefixes, multi-line strings, identifiers) | `crates/aipo-lexer` |
| Conversion `String(value)` | `crates/aipo-vm::convert` |
| Concatenation `+`, which interpolation (`f"…"`) lowers to | `crates/aipo-vm::value` |
| `lower`, `upper`, `capitalize`, `replace`, `join`, `format`, `reverse` | `crates/aipo-stdlib` |

Operations that are pure substrings (`slice`, `split`, `trim`) preserve the invariant for free:
removing characters never makes two previously non-adjacent characters adjacent. `==` stays
structural equality over the stored value. Reading a constant out of the bytecode pool is *not* a
normalization point, because the only producer of program-visible string constants is the lexer;
the point would need revisiting if an input boundary (host text input, `Bytes.decode()`) enters
the MVP.

## Error model

Two distinct channels, never mixed:

- **Recoverable `Failure`** (Model B) — domain problems a program can recover from with
  `or_else` / `attempt … failed … end`: invalid text in conversions, out-of-range `Byte`,
  missing `format` key, negative `sqrt`, inverted `clamp` bounds.
- **Runtime fault (`VmFault`)** — programming or contract violations that are not
  recoverable: wrong operand category, wrong arity, empty `split`/`replace` separator,
  non-`String` `join` element, numeric overflow past the `Int` range, non-finite `Float`.

No Rust panic escapes as an Aipo error; every native returns `Result`.

## Contracts and invariant boundaries

The subset keeps two written promises, and both are checked while the program runs:

- **Signature contracts** (`name: Type`, `name!: Type`, `-> T`, `T?`) are checked at the call
  boundary — parameters in the callee's prologue, after the default prologue so a defaulted value
  is checked too, and returns immediately before each `return expr`. `T?` means exactly `T` or
  `none`; the simple `Function` contract only requires the value to be callable; a `struct` name is
  matched against the instance's type. A violation discovered at runtime is the fault channel
  above (`AIPO_RT_TYPE_MISMATCH`). A contract the analyzer can already prove wrong — a literal
  argument or return against a written core-type contract — is reported *before* execution as
  `AIPO_SEM_CONTRACT_VIOLATION_STATIC`, so a provable mistake never waits for the run.
- **Interface contracts** are structural, as canon keeps interfaces: naming one asks whether the
  value exposes the operations it declares, compared by **caller-visible arity** (the receiver is
  not an argument at a call site). A value without the operation, or with a same-named operation
  of a different arity, is a contract fault, and the message names the declared struct type. `none`
  satisfies `T?` without exposing anything.
- **`invariant()`** is verified at the end of construction — a fault, because the instance must
  never be published in a forbidden state — and at stable mutable boundaries, which are the
  **recoverable `Failure`** channel, because there is an entry state to restore. A field
  assignment to a published instance is provisional until the enclosing boundary (the end of the
  operation, or the mutation statement itself in the entry script): when the predicate fails, the
  direct fields of every participating instance return to their entry values and the operation
  produces a `Failure`. Validation never runs after each internal assignment, so an operation may
  pass through a transiently invalid state.

## Deferred surface

Outside this slice (tracked in ADP-001/ADP-002 and the canon backlog): `format` positional
placeholders and format specifiers (`{price:.2f}`), `Bytes` packing APIs (`read_i32`/`write_f32`/…,
`String.encode`/`Bytes.decode`), `casefold`, `graphemes`, `words`, `lines`, explicit advanced
Unicode normalization, `Set`, lazy `Sequence`, regex/json/fs/http and every capability-aware
module. Wave 1 non-delivery that Wave 2 slice W2-1 has since closed (see
`docs/evidence/P01-G01-js-parity-mvp-subset.md`): the `aipo-js` backend now ships
the MVP subset with differential parity (CLI is `run`/`check`/`build`/`fmt`).
Wave 3 has since closed `Set`, lazy `Sequence`, the `Bytes` packing APIs
(`read_i32`/`write_f32`/…, `String.encode`/`Bytes.decode`), `Duration` and the whole async
surface (`Task`/`Group` values, a cooperative scheduler, `async fn`/`await`/`await do` and the
`task.*` combinators) — see `docs/evidence/P02-G01-wave3-types-and-values.md`.

Wave 4 has since started the host ABI (`aipo-host`) and closed the `time` clock module on both
backends (`time.now`/`time.monotonic` behind the `clock` capabilities, with a deterministic test
profile) — see `docs/evidence/P03-G01-host-abi.md`.

Still explicitly deferred: LSP and REPL, packages/registry, regex/json/fs/http, `Date`/
`TimeOfDay`/`DateTime`, the ECS host (`aipo-poppy`) and hot reload. Type values for `List`/`Dict`/`Bytes` and a
dedicated `Byte` runtime kind were listed here previously and are now delivered — see
`docs/evidence/P00-G10-backend-completion.md`.
