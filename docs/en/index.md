## A Frictionless Developer Experience

**Aipo** is designed for engineers who prize reasoning clarity, predictability, and speed. Rather than dangerous implicit type coercions (like `"1" + 2 == "12"`), Aipo pairs dynamic, strong typing with **optional structural contracts**, **transactional failure recovery with automatic rollback**, and a **self-contained toolchain without external dependencies**.

```aipo
# Interface with automatic structural subtyping
interface Notifiable {
    fn summary(self) -> String
}

# Struct with fields immutable by default and explicit var mutability
struct Account {
    id: Int
    holder: String
    var balance: Int
}

impl Account {
    # Transactional integrity invariant
    invariant() {
        self.balance >= 0
    }

    # Explicit receiver mutation with `var self`
    fn transfer(var self, target: Account, amount: Int) {
        if amount <= 0 {
            fail("transfer amount must be positive")
        }

        # If any rule is broken, both accounts undergo an atomic rollback
        attempt {
            self.balance -= amount
            target.balance += amount
        } failed err {
            fail(f"transfer safely aborted: {err.message}")
        }
    }

    fn summary(self) -> String {
        return f"Account #{self.id} ({self.holder}): ${self.balance // 100}"
    }
}

# Symmetrical colon instantiation
var a1 = Account{ id: 101, holder: "Alex", balance: 25000 }
var a2 = Account{ id: 102, holder: "Beatrice", balance: 5000 }

a1.transfer(a2, 5000)
io.println(a1.summary())
io.println(a2.summary())
```
