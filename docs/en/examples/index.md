# Practical Examples & Code Recipes

This section brings together idiomatic code patterns, real-world recipes, and the complete catalog of the 25 canonical examples that accompany the official Aipo repository.

## 1. Data Pipeline with `|>` and Higher-Order Functions

The pipeline operator `|>` passes the result of the preceding expression as the first argument of the following function, creating readable, left-to-right processing streams:

```aipo
struct Product {
    name: String
    price: Int
    category: String
}

let catalog = [
    Product{ name: "Keyboard", price: 250, category: "Hardware" },
    Product{ name: "Rust Guide", price: 120, category: "Education" },
    Product{ name: "Optical Mouse", price: 80, category: "Hardware" },
    Product{ name: "4K Monitor", price: 2200, category: "Hardware" }
]

# Filter affordable hardware (< $500) and extract product names
fn filter_affordable_hardware(items, ceiling: Int) {
    return items
        .filter(fn (p) { return p.category == "Hardware" and p.price <= ceiling })
        .transform(fn (p) { return p.name })
}

let affordable = catalog |> filter_affordable_hardware(300)
each name in affordable {
    io.println(f"Available: {name}")
}
```

## 2. Domain Modeling with Invariants and Atomic Rollback

In Aipo, structs equipped with `invariant()` hooks safeguard their internal invariants at every stable mutable boundary. If a method breaks an invariant or issues a `fail(...)`, **all changes undergo an immediate atomic rollback**:

```aipo
struct Wallet {
    user: String
    var balance: Int
}

impl Wallet {
    # Ensures the balance is never negative at any time
    invariant() {
        self.balance >= 0
    }

    fn credit(var self, amount: Int) {
        if amount <= 0 {
            fail("credit amount must be positive")
        }
        self.balance += amount
    }

    fn debit(var self, amount: Int) {
        self.balance -= amount
    }
}

let w = Wallet{ user: "Lucas", balance: 150 }

attempt {
    w.credit(50)     # balance increases to 200
    w.debit(500)     # violation: balance would become -300!
} failed err {
    io.println(f"Operation rejected: {err.message}")
}

# The balance remains 150 (the previous valid state was completely restored)
io.println(f"Safe balance: {w.balance}")
```

---

## 3. Concurrency with `async`, `task`, and `await do`

Aipo's concurrency model is cooperative, deterministic, and task-driven:

```aipo
async fn fetch_user(id: Int) {
    # Simulates deterministic network latency
    let timer = task.sleep(50)
    await do { timer }
    return {"id": id, "name": "Aipo Dev"}
}

async fn fetch_permissions(id: Int) {
    let timer = task.sleep(30)
    await do { timer }
    return ["read", "write", "deploy"]
}

async fn load_profile(id: Int) {
    # Spawn two concurrent tasks
    let t_user = task.spawn(fn () { return fetch_user(id) })
    let t_perms = task.spawn(fn () { return fetch_permissions(id) })

    # Await both sequentially and safely
    var user = none
    var perms = none

    await do {
        user = t_user
        perms = t_perms
    }

    return {"user": user, "permissions": perms}
}
```

## 4. Safe JSON Serialization and Parsing

The standard library `json` module provides strict, unambiguous handling:

```aipo
let payload_text = '{"service": "auth", "port": 8080, "active": true}'

# Safe parsing with fallback using or_else
let data = json.parse(payload_text) or_else fail("Malformed JSON")

io.println(f"Service: {data['service']}")
io.println(f"Port: {data['port']}")

# Serializing structured values
let response = {
    "status": "ok",
    "timestamp": 1727376000
}
let generated_json = json.stringify(response)
io.println(generated_json)
```
