# Official Packages & Frameworks

The official ecosystem of the **Aipo** programming language consists of high-level libraries and frameworks engineered with the same rigor, safety-by-default, and determinism as the core compiler.

In accordance with language governance, **domain-specific features (such as HTML, CSS, UI, simulations, and audio) do not bloat the compiler grammar**. Instead, they are distributed as canonical packages managed via `aipo package`.

## How to Use an Official Package

In your project's `aipo.toml`, declare the dependency under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
[package]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
"aipo.html" = { path = "packages/aipo-html" }
```

Then in your `.aipo` source code:

```aipo
import aipo.html as h

h.div(class: "app") {
    h.h1("Built with Aipo!")
}
```
