# Aipo — CLI Reference

**Status:** normative
**Scope:** command surface, machine output, exit codes, and examples for Aipo CLI
**Blocking question:** Which commands are stable?

## Stable commands

The stable command surface comprises (`run`/`check`/`fmt` stable since Wave 1,
`build` stable since Wave 2, `disasm` stable since Wave 4):

- `aipo run <file.aipo> [--package-cache <dir>]`: Compiles and executes an Aipo source file. The optional cache flag consumes a previously locked mixed local/GitHub graph without network access.
- `aipo run <file.aibc>`: Loads, verifies and executes a pre-compiled bytecode file.
- `aipo check <file.aipo> [--package-cache <dir>]`: Runs the frontend and semantic analysis without bytecode execution, emitting diagnostics. The optional cache flag consumes a previously locked mixed local/GitHub graph without network access.
- `aipo build <file.aipo> [--out <dir>] [--package-cache <dir>]`: Emits a JavaScript bundle (`app.js` + `aipo-runtime.js` + `app.js.map`, ESM with ECMA-426 source maps) to `<dir>` (`<parent>/dist` by default). Fails with the same diagnostic codes as `check` and emits no files on failure; runtime faults surface when `node` runs the bundle, with the same codes as `run`.
- `aipo disasm <file.aipo|file.aibc> [--package-cache <dir>]`: Disassembles a source or bytecode file, printing a human-readable listing. Source files (`.aipo`) include line/column annotations; bytecode files (`.aibc`) show raw instruction offsets.
- `aipo fmt [files...]`: Formats source files idempotently according to canonical indentation rules.
- `aipo package lock <package-dir> [--fetch-github --cache <dir>] [--github-token-env <name>]`: Resolves a local package graph and writes `aipo.lock` in the package root. The explicit fetch form also resolves pinned GitHub dependencies and may access the network. Authentication is opt-in through an environment-variable name.
- `aipo package audit <package-dir>`: Resolves a local package graph and verifies the existing `aipo.lock` without rewriting it.
- `aipo package cache verify <cache-dir>`: Audits every existing GitHub cache entry without network access or filesystem mutation.
- `aipo package cache prune <cache-dir> --lock <lockfile> [--apply]`: Removes only verified cache entries not referenced by the explicit lockfile; dry-run is the default.

## Local package entries

For `.aipo` inputs, `run`, `check`, `build`, and `disasm` look for the nearest `aipo.toml` in the
entry file's ancestor directories. When present, local `path` dependencies are resolved before
module linking. A qualified import such as `import acme.http` binds the local namespace `http`;
`import acme.http as h` binds `h`. The full coordinate remains the module identity.

Resolution for these source commands is local-only unless `--package-cache <dir>` is explicitly
provided. The flag consumes a previously locked mixed local/GitHub graph and its verified cache
entries without network access. A missing lockfile is allowed only without the flag. Without an
`aipo.toml`, source files keep the legacy sibling-module lookup.

## Opt-in public GitHub fetch

The HTTP adapter is compiled only with the `github-http` feature. The default `aipo` binary remains
network-free. Enable it explicitly when fetching a public package or locking a mixed root:

```bash
cargo run -p aipo-cli --features github-http -- \\
  package fetch-github owner/repository 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 \\
  [subpath] --cache <cache-dir> --out <output-dir> [--github-token-env <name>]

cargo run -p aipo-cli --features github-http -- \\
  package lock ./my-package --fetch-github --cache <cache-dir> \\
  [--github-token-env <name>]
```

The command accepts only a public repository slug, an exact lowercase 40-hex commit, and a safe
relative subpath. A manifest dependency uses the same source fields and also requires an exact
SemVer version:

```toml
[dependencies]
"acme.http" = { version = "1.0.0", type = "github", repository = "acme/packages", revision = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567", subpath = "." }
```

By default, the command sends public GET requests without `Authorization` or other credentials.
With `--github-token-env <name>`, the named environment variable supplies a validated bearer
credential. The variable value is never accepted as a CLI value, persisted, logged or included in
diagnostics. Missing, empty or control-character-bearing values fail before the request. Requests
always use HTTPS, reject redirects, apply a timeout and a 4 MiB response limit, and use the explicit
cache root. The command recursively fetches pinned GitHub dependencies, validates coordinates,
versions, capabilities and cycles, enforces a 256-package graph bound, and writes a complete graph
lockfile in the output snapshot. Each artifact is cached and digest-verified independently. The
output directory must be empty. A remote artifact cannot declare a local `path` dependency in this
slice.

For a mixed local root, `package lock --fetch-github` leaves local path inputs in the project and
fetches only its pinned GitHub edges into the same explicit cache. This is the only lock form that
can access the network; plain `package lock` and `package audit` remain local-only.

## Offline cache consumption

A locked mixed local/GitHub graph can be compiled without the HTTP feature or network access:

```bash
aipo check my-package/src/main.aipo --package-cache .aipo-cache
aipo run my-package/src/main.aipo --package-cache=.aipo-cache
```

The command requires `aipo.lock`, verifies every cached GitHub manifest and entry against the lock
projection, follows all local path branches, and never creates a missing cache root. A missing
artifact, corrupt cache, or stale lock fails closed. The cache is read-only for these commands; only
`fetch-github` and `package lock --fetch-github` write it.

Failures use `AIPO_PKG_FETCH` for transport/cache/artifact failures and `AIPO_PKG_RESOLUTION` for
graph failures. Without `--package-cache`, source commands never touch the cache or network.
Plain `package lock` and `package audit` remain local-only; only the explicit mixed-lock form can fetch.

## Cache verification

Cache verification is an explicit, read-only maintenance operation:

```bash
aipo package cache verify .aipo-cache
```

The verifier scans namespace entries in deterministic order and checks directory/file safety,
metadata source identity, cache-key consistency, manifest parsing and SHA-256 content digests.
It continues after independent entry failures and reports each failure as `AIPO_PKG_FETCH`.
A missing or empty cache is a successful zero-entry report. Verification never creates, repairs,
deletes, prunes or fetches cache data and is available in the default network-free build.

## Cache pruning and retention

Pruning is lockfile-driven and deliberately conservative:

```bash
aipo package cache prune .aipo-cache --lock aipo.lock
aipo package cache prune .aipo-cache --lock aipo.lock --apply
```

The first form is a dry-run and lists verified entries not referenced by the lockfile. `--apply`
is required for deletion. If verification finds any invalid entry, pruning fails closed and deletes
nothing; corrupt or unknown entries are never removed automatically. Sources referenced by the
lockfile are always retained, and the lockfile itself is never changed. Pruning performs no network
access, authentication or registry lookup.

aipo run <path> [--package-cache <dir>] [--message-format=<human|jsonl>]
aipo check <path> [--package-cache <dir>] [--message-format=<human|jsonl>]
aipo build <path> [--out <dir>] [--package-cache <dir>] [--message-format=<human|jsonl>]
aipo disasm <path> [--package-cache <dir>] [--message-format=<human|jsonl>]
aipo fmt <paths...> [--check]
aipo package lock <package-dir> [--fetch-github --cache <dir>] [--github-token-env <name>]
aipo package audit <package-dir>
aipo package cache verify <cache-dir>
aipo package cache prune <cache-dir> --lock <lockfile> [--apply]
aipo --version
aipo --help
```

## Machine output

When `--message-format=jsonl` is specified, all compiler and package errors, warnings, and runtime faults are emitted to standard error as newline-delimited JSON matching the diagnostic catalog schema:

```json
{"code":"AIPO_SEM_UNKNOWN_NAME","severity":"error","message":"unknown variable 'y'","primary_span":{"file":"main.aipo","start":11,"end":16,"line":2,"column":1},"notes":[],"suggestions":[]}
```

## Exit codes

- `0`: Success (program ran to completion, check found no errors, or format succeeded).
- `1`: Language/package failure (parse error, semantic error, package resolution or stale-lock diagnostic, uncaught runtime fault, or check failed).
- `2`: CLI usage error (invalid command-line arguments, missing file, unrecognized flag, or filesystem failure).

## Examples

Run a script:
```bash
aipo run main.aipo
```

Run a pre-compiled bytecode file:
```bash
aipo run main.aibc
```

Check a script with machine-readable diagnostics:
```bash
aipo check main.aipo --message-format=jsonl
```

Disassemble a source file (with line annotations):
```bash
aipo disasm main.aipo
```

Disassemble a bytecode file:
```bash
aipo disasm main.aibc
```

Format files in-place:
```bash
aipo fmt src/**/*.aipo
```

Build a JavaScript bundle and run it with Node (requires Node >= 20):
```bash
aipo build main.aipo --out dist
node dist/app.js
```

Create and audit a local package lockfile:
```bash
aipo package lock .
aipo package audit .
```

Lock a local root with pinned GitHub dependencies, then consume it offline:
```bash
cargo run -p aipo-cli --features github-http -- \\
  package lock . --fetch-github --cache .aipo-cache \\
  --github-token-env AIPO_GITHUB_TOKEN
aipo check src/main.aipo --package-cache .aipo-cache
aipo package cache verify .aipo-cache
aipo package cache prune .aipo-cache --lock aipo.lock
```
