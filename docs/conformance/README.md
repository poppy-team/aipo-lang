# Aipo — Conformance Corpus (slice S11)

**Status:** normative (process level)
**Authority:** implements `docs/waves/wave-1-mvp.md` (S11) and `docs/reference/cli.md`
**Scope:** corpus layout, snapshot matrix, regeneration, gate rubric
**Update Triggers:** new fixture kind, snapshot format change, gate criteria change

## Purpose

The corpus is the shared, executable definition of the Wave 1 MVP subset. It is the artifact
that the CLI, the formatter and the language agree on: everything the MVP claims is either
run here with a committed output, or rejected here with a committed diagnostic code.

Nothing in this directory is generated at build time except the `.stdout` snapshots, and the
snapshot for a program is only ever rewritten on request (see *Regeneration*).

## Layout

| Directory | Kind | Pairing | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `programs/` | runnable programs | `NN_name.aipo` + `NN_name.stdout` | `aipo-cli` conformance suite |
| `diagnostics/` | programs that must fail | `NN_name.aipo` + `NN_name.code` | `aipo-cli` conformance suite |
| `formatting/` | formatter golden corpus | `NN_name.input.aipo` + `NN_name.expected.aipo` | `aipo-formatter` golden suite and `aipo fmt --check` |
| `modules/` | multi-file module cases | `modules/<case>/{entry.aipo, *.aipo}` + `entry.stdout` / `entry.code` | `aipo-cli` conformance suite |

### Fixture invariants

- **`programs/*.stdout`** is the exact standard output of `aipo run`. A program whose output
  changes must have its snapshot reviewed, never silently rewritten.
- **`diagnostics/*.code`** lists one diagnostic code per line. Every listed code must appear
  in stderr, so a fixture that starts failing for the *wrong* reason fails the suite too.
- **`formatting/*.expected.aipo`** is both the expected output of the formatter and a
  canonical source: `fmt --check` on it must be a no-op, and the formatter must be idempotent
  on it.
- **`modules/<case>/`** holds one `entry.aipo` plus the modules it imports. An entry is a
  failure fixture when a sibling `<entry>.code` exists, and a passing fixture otherwise; the
  other `.aipo` files in the case are import targets, not entry points.

## Snapshot matrix

| Program fixture | Covers |
|---|---|
| `01_hello` | literals, `String()` conversion, `io.println` |
| `02_recursion` | recursion, `return`, base cases |
| `03_control_flow` | `if`/`elif`/`else`, `match`/`when`, `loop`, `while`, `repeat`, `each`, `break`, `continue` |
| `04_collections` | `List`/`Dict` literals, core collection method APIs, indexing |
| `05_structs_and_impl` | `struct` with defaults, construction, `impl` methods, associated functions |
| `06_closures` | anonymous `fn`, capture, per-iteration capture in loops |
| `07_strings_and_math` | `string` and `math` modules, `find`/`replace`/`split`/`join`, rounding modes |
| `08_failures` | `fail`, `or_else`, `attempt`/`failed`, `err.message` |
| `09_slicing` | ranges `a..b`, list/string slicing with negative bounds |
| `10_integrated` | several features combined in one program |
| `11_defaults_and_named_args` | default parameters evaluated per call, defaults referencing earlier parameters, named arguments in any order, pipeline into a call |
| `12_bytes` | `Bytes(count)` construction, byte indexing, `len`, slicing |
| `13_init_and_invariant` | `Type{...}` runs `init` when declared (with defaults and `fixed` assignment), `invariant()` verified at the end of construction |
| `14_signature_contracts` | `name: Type`, `name!: Type`, `-> T`, `T?`, checked default, the `Function` contract, a `struct` contract and a mutable receiver |
| `15_invariant_on_mutation` | `invariant()` at stable mutable boundaries: commit, rollback with the entry value preserved (method and direct assignment) and rollback of two instances in one operation |
| `16_interface_contracts` | `satisfy` plus an interface used as a written contract: structural conformance at runtime, `T?` accepting `none`, an interface operation with an argument |
| `17_unicode_nfc` | NFC at the construction boundaries: escaped literal, concatenation, interpolation, `join`, `replace`, `format`, case mapping, `reverse`, and a mark with no precomposed form surviving normalization |
| `18_tolerant_slices_and_clamp` | tolerant slices (above the end, before the start, inverted) for `List`, `String` and `Bytes`; `math.clamp` with inverted bounds as a recoverable `Failure`; mixed numeric promotion in `min`/`max` |
| `19_local_functions` | local `fn` declarations: shared `var` capture (canon's `create_counter`), self-recursion through the local name, and a local `fn` reading an enclosing parameter |
| `20_module_scope` | module-scope visibility: a top-level `var` read and mutated by a module function (canon's `var counter` + `fn bump` pattern) and a top-level `let` read from one |
| `21_attempt_recovery_and_journal` | `return fail(…)` propagating to the caller's `attempt` boundary, and recovery releasing pre-handler journal entries (only post-handler mutations roll back) |
| `22_signed_zero` | IEEE signed zero: `-0.0` observable in `Float` display, `Int` arithmetic never producing negative zero (normalized on the JS backend) |
| `23_init_in_parameterized_fn` | construction with `init` inside a parameterized function (fuzz-found IR builder panic regression) |

| `16_sem_return_contract` | `AIPO_SEM_CONTRACT_VIOLATION_STATIC` (literal returned against `-> T`) |
| `17_runtime_interface_contract` | `AIPO_RT_TYPE_MISMATCH` (a value without the operation an interface declares) |
| `18_runtime_interface_arity` | `AIPO_RT_TYPE_MISMATCH` (a same-named operation of the wrong caller-visible arity) |
| `19_runtime_clamp_inverted_bounds` | `AIPO_RT_FAILURE_UNCAUGHT` (unhandled inverted `clamp` bounds) |

## Regeneration

Snapshot files are written by the suite when the environment asks for it:

```bash
AIPO_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test -p aipo-cli --test conformance
```

This rewrites `programs/*.stdout` and `modules/**/*.stdout`. Everything else — diagnostic
codes, formatter expectations, module fixtures — is authored by hand, because those files are
specifications rather than observations. A diff in a regenerated snapshot is a language change
and must be reviewed as one.

## Gauntlet rubric

The S11 rubric scores the MVP on five gates. Each gate has one owner command and one piece of
evidence, so a score cannot be claimed without a reproducible command.

| Gate | Weight | Command | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executable MVP | 30% | `cargo test -p aipo-cli --test conformance` | all program and module fixtures run green against committed snapshots |
| Diagnostic discipline | 20% | same suite, failure tests | every fixture fails with its committed code, and no fixture fails for an unrelated reason |
| Determinism | 20% | `cargo test -p aipo-formatter` + `fmt --check` corpus tests | formatter is idempotent; canonical sources report no drift; `fmt --check` never rewrites |
| Robustness | 15% | `cargo test -p aipo-cli --test fuzz_smoke` | no input makes the pipeline panic; malformed input yields a diagnostic and exit code 1 or 2 |
| Repository gates | 15% | `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo doc` | all four green |

### Gauntlet score — `P00-G16` hand-off (100%)

Scored 2026-09-19 from the repository root (rustc/cargo 1.98.1). Full hand-off in
`docs/evidence/P00-G16-wave-1-exit-review.md`.

| Gate | Weight | Exact command | Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executable MVP | 30% | `cargo test -p aipo-cli --test conformance` | **pass** — 13/13 |
| Diagnostic discipline | 20% | same suite, failure tests (`test_failing_fixtures_report_expected_diagnostic_codes`, `test_module_failures_report_expected_diagnostic_codes`) | **pass** |
| Determinism | 20% | `cargo test -p aipo-formatter` | **pass** — 6 + 4 + 1 = 11/11 |
| Robustness | 15% | `cargo test -p aipo-cli --test fuzz_smoke` | **pass** — 3/3 |
| Repository gates | 15% | `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace` (146/146), `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` | **pass** |

Inventory verified on disk: `programs/` 23 `.aipo` + 23 `.stdout`, `diagnostics/` 19 `.aipo` +
19 `.code`, `formatting/` 8 `.input.aipo` + 8 `.expected.aipo`, `modules/` 3 entry points
(`basic`, `cycle`, `missing`).

## Verified gaps

The corpus records what works. What the MVP subset lists but the implementation does not yet
deliver is tracked in `docs/adp/` (no-invention policy).

The five gaps the S11 corpus found are recorded in
`docs/adp/ADP-002-construction-hooks-and-runtime-contracts.md`, and all of them are closed and
certified here:

| Gap | Closed by | Certified by |
|---|---|---|
| G1 — `init` on construction | `P00-G13` | `programs/13_init_and_invariant` |
| G2 — `invariant()` at the end of construction | `P00-G13` | `programs/13_init_and_invariant`, `diagnostics/11_runtime_invariant_violation` |
| G4 — `Bytes(count)` construction | `P00-G13` | `programs/12_bytes` |
| G2b — `invariant()` at mutation boundaries | `P00-G14` | `programs/15_invariant_on_mutation`, `diagnostics/14_runtime_invariant_mutation_uncaught` |
| G3 — signature contracts at runtime | `P00-G14` | `programs/14_signature_contracts`, `diagnostics/12_runtime_contract_violation`, `diagnostics/13_runtime_return_contract` |

The three residual limits `P00-G14` left open were closed by `P00-G15` and are certified here:

| Residual | Closed by | Certified by |
|---|---|---|
| `aipo-sema` did not use the written annotations for a pre-execution report | `P00-G15` | `diagnostics/15_sem_contract_violation`, `diagnostics/16_sem_return_contract` |
| Interface contracts were accepted instead of checked by structural conformance | `P00-G15` | `programs/16_interface_contracts`, `diagnostics/17_runtime_interface_contract`, `diagnostics/18_runtime_interface_arity` |
| The ADP-001 questions on inverted `clamp` bounds, slice saturation and NFC construction boundaries were open | `P00-G15` | `programs/17_unicode_nfc`, `programs/18_tolerant_slices_and_clamp`, `diagnostics/19_runtime_clamp_inverted_bounds` |
| Module bindings were invisible inside `fn`/`impl` bodies and local `fn` declarations collapsed into anonymous closures | `P00-G16` | `programs/19_local_functions`, `programs/20_module_scope` |

What the MVP subset declares but the implementation still does not deliver is explicit
non-delivery, not an open gap (see `docs/evidence/P00-G16-wave-1-exit-review.md` and
`docs/stdlib/mvp-subset.md` Deferred): `Bytes` packing APIs, the Wave 2 backend (`aipo-js`),
`Set`/`Sequence`, LSP/REPL, async/await, host ABI/Poppy, packages/registry, regex/json/fs/http,
`graphemes` and hot reload.
