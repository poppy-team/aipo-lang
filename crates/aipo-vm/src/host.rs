//! VM-side adapter for the host ABI (`aipo-host`).
//!
//! `aipo-host` owns the contracts a host and a script share; this module is the one place
//! that consumes them, so the value model, the fault model and the capability gate have a
//! single conversion point instead of each call site inventing its own.
//!
//! Three conversions live here:
//!
//! - **Values.** A [`HostValue`] becomes a [`Value`] and back. Host values are plain data, so
//!   the conversion never hands a script a Rust reference; a `String` is normalized to NFC as
//!   it becomes a language value, because NFC belongs to the language's `String` boundary and
//!   the host side deliberately does not duplicate that rule.
//! - **Faults.** A [`HostFault`] becomes a [`VmFault`], never a panic and never a recoverable
//!   `Failure`: canon classifies a denied capability, a stale handle and an escaped binding as
//!   programming errors at the boundary.
//! - **Capabilities.** [`HostContext`] holds the deny-by-default [`CapabilitySet`] the running
//!   profile granted plus the host objects behind their handles. A privileged operation calls
//!   [`HostContext::require`] first, so a missing capability is always the same fault.
