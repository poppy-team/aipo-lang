//! Conservative optimization passes over target-neutral Core IR.
//!
//! Every pass rewrites one function's instruction stream and returns an
//! index map so absolute jump targets can be re-noted. Removing an instruction
//! renumbers every target after it, so the passes are only correct together
//! with `remap_jump_targets`; that function is applied after each round.
//!
//! The passes never change observable behaviour: constant folding evaluates
//! only total subexpressions, peephole removes no-op shapes, and dead-code
//! elimination keeps every address a jump can reach.
